;; vector after :keys in associative destructuring can contain:

;;    x        x        :x            symbol without namespace

;; In all cases above, the Clojure expression (symbol nil (name elem))
;; could take the value in the column 'Vector element example', and

;; There should be no warnings for this function.  It simply
;; demonstates most of the kinds of things that can legally be inside
;; the vector after a :keys key in associative destructuring.  (It
;; leaves out symbols that have no namespace, but there are plenty of

;; No duplicate local names in foo12, but it does have local name 'f'

;; Eastwood's :unused-or-default warning can warn about a local name as
;; a key in an :or map that does not appear elsewhere.  I believe that
;; such a local name that is a key in an :or map only applies to local
;; names bound in the same 'level' of map destructuring where the :or
;; appears.  That is, if there are nested sub-maps or sub-vectors
;; destructuring within that map with the :or, that :or does not 'see'
;; or apply to them.  It doesn't apply to siblings or parents in the
;; 'tree' of destructuring things, either.

              ;; Similarly for the f on the next line.  Both keys in

;; macroexpanding this function demonstarates that the 'c' in the :or
;; map below does _not_ have any effect on the value of c bound by the
;; arg vector below via the ':as c' portion.  This makes sense, since
;; c should be bound to the entire associative value passed as the
;; first parameter, regardless of its contents, and a default value
;; doesn't make sense.  This is an example where a warning that the
;; 'c' in the :or {c 5} part of the arg vector should ideally trigger
;; a warning.

;; TBD: Implement ability in Eastwood to look for these kinds of
;; warnings for destructuring expressions within let, loop, and other
;; macros that support destructuring.

;; Things in Clojure core that can use destructure:

;; let - Direct call to destructure.
;; loop - Direct call to destructure.
;; fn - Macro that calls fn maybe-destructured, which can return
;;    expression that includes let.
;; defn - macro expansion to fn.
;; defmacro - macro expansion to defn.
;; for - macro expansion can include let and/or loop
;; doseq - macro expansion can include let and/or loop
;; if-let - macro expansion includes let
;; when-let - macro expansion includes let
;; if-some - macro expansion includes let
;; when-some - macro expansion includes let

;; TBD: It would be nice if there was a way to detect all such uses,
;; even in user-defined macros that use clojure.core/destructure, but
;; that is a function, not a macro, so not clear how to do that in
;; Eastwood.

;; TBD: What happens with macros that have repeated parameter names?
;; Can Eastwood easily detect them?

;; TBD: Can macros use destructuring with their parameters?  How do
;; they look in ASTs?
