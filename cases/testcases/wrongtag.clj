;; When the return type tag is on the arg vector and it is a Java
;; class, Clojure can handle any class name just fine when defining
;; the function, and wherever calling it, except in one case described
;; in CLJ-1232:

;; If the class is not imported by default into Clojure (it imports
;; those in java.lang by default), but it is imported where the
;; function is defined, and the tag is on the arg vector, and it is
;; not fully qualified, and the function is called from a different
;; namespace where the class is not imported, then Clojure 1.6.0
;; compiler will throw an exception where the call is, indicating that
;; the class is unknown.

;; Thus Eastwood will warn about function definitions like this, in an
;; effort to help the developer more quickly discover the solution.
;; The thing that works for now in all cases is to fully qualify the
;; class name where the function is defined.  This does not require
;; the caller of the function to import the class.

;; Eastwood avoids issuing a warning if the function is also declared
;; private, since there are cases of this in existing libraries, and
;; it is very unlikely that the error will be hit for such a function
;; (or perhaps even impossible).
