;; It would be nice if the (dec i) expression caused an

;; enough to notice that the enclosing do has its return value
;; ignored, and thus the final expression within the do also has its
;; return value ignored.

;; TBD: The :op for the body of the doseq is :do.  If we find that,
;; then the return values of every expression in the do are also
;; ignored, so iterate through them, doing the same checks on all
;; subforms.  Go through the :statements sequence elements, and the
;; :ret child, too.  Even the :ret child has its return value ignored,
;; because the do form as a whole does.

;; Actually the statements will already be gone through.  It is only
