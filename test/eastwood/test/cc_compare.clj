(defn cc-cmp
  "cc-cmp compares two values x and y.  As a comparator, it returns a
negative, 0, or positive integer if x is less than, equal to, or
greater than y.

cc-cmp can compare values of many types, including numbers, strings,
symbols, keywords, vectors, lists, sequences, sets, maps, records,
Java arrays, anything that implements the Java Comparable
interface (including booleans, characters, File, URL, UUID, Clojure
refs), and nil.

Unlike the function compare, it sorts vectors in lexicographic order.
It also sorts lists, sequences, and Java arrays in lexicographic
order, on which compare throws exceptions.

Also unlike compare, cc-cmp can compare values of different types to
each other without throwing an exception, if it can compare them at
all.  Values of different types are sorted relative to each other by a
string that is the name of their class.  Note that all numbers use the
string \"java.lang.Number\" so that numbers are sorted together,
rather than separated out by type, and for a similar reason all
vectors, lists, and sequences use the string
\"clojure.lang.Sequential\".  All sets use the string
\"clojure.lang.IPersistentSet\", and all maps and records use the
string \"clojure.lang.IPersistentMap\".  All Java arrays use the
string \"java.util.Arrays\" (that is not the name of any instantiable
class -- it is simply used for sorting Java arrays versus other
objects).

cc-cmp throws an exception if given any type of value not mentioned
above, e.g. Java arrays."
