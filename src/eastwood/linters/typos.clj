;; Note: Walking the asts and looking for keywords also finds keywords

;; they typed and warn about similar keywords there only.

;; The only disadvantage I know of in doing it this way is that
;; binding forms like {:keys [k1 k2 k3]} will see k1 k2 k3 as symbols
;; k1 k2 k3, not keywords :k1 :k2 :k3.

;; If we used the forms as read during analysis, there is the
;; disadvantage that any backquoted expressions will have keywords
;; like :line, :column, :end-line, and :end-column 'leak' from the
;; metadata added by the reader into the backquoted expression as
;; read.

;; Instead, re-read the forms from the string given by the :source key
;; on the linter argument, in a way that will not attach this :line
;; :column etc. metadata, implemented in string->forms.

;; suspicious-macro-invocations was formerly called
;; suspicious-expressions-forms, and implemented to use the 'forms'
;; key, not the asts.  That was closer to the original source code,
;; before macro expansion, so it would give warnings for expressions
;; that we would prefer it not warn, like this one:

;; (-> x (doto (method args)))     ; macro expands to (doto x (method args))

;; The newer version suspicious-macro-invocations uses the asts, which
;; contain forms on the key :raw-forms, to see what the forms looked
;; like before macroexpansion.  This should avoid the issue above.

;; For suspicious function calls, we check for them in the asts in
;; suspicious-fn-calls below, but that will not find suspicious calls
;; on macros, nor on clojure.test/is forms.

;; suspicious-is-try-expr looks for suspicious expressions in calls to
;; clojure.test/is like these examples below.  Special detection code
;; is needed because of the unusual way that clojure.test/is
;; macroexpands.

;; (is (= (+ 1 1)) 2)   warn for (= x)
;; (is (> (+ 1 1)) 1)   warn for (> x)
;; (is (-> 1 (= 1)))    This case is warning as desired already, no warning
;; (is (-> 1 (=)))      Also warning as desired now, warn for (= x) not (=)
