;; Note: Walking the asts and looking for keywords also finds keywords
;; from macro expansions, ones that the developer never typed in their
;; code.  Better to use the forms to stay closer to the source code
;; they typed and warn about similar keywords there only.

;; The only disadvantage I know of in doing it this way is that
;; binding forms like {:keys [k1 k2 k3]} will see k1 k2 k3 as symbols
;; k1 k2 k3, not keywords :k1 :k2 :k3.

;; If we used the forms as read during analysis, there is the
;; disadvantage that any backquoted expressions will have keywords
;; like :line, :column, :end-line, and :end-column 'leak' from the
;; metadata added by the reader into the backquoted expression as
;; read.

;; Instead, re-read the forms from the string given by the :source key
;; on the linter argument, in a way that will not attach this :line
;; :column etc. metadata, implemented in string->forms.
