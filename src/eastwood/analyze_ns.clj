      include all forms in the file, as far as the file could be
      successfully read, even if an exception was thrown earlier than
      that during analysis or evaluation of the forms.

  :asts - a sequence of ASTs of the forms that were successfully
      analyzed without exception.  They correspond one-to-one with
      forms in the :forms sequence.

  :exception - nil if no exception occurred.  An Exception object if
      an exception was thrown during analysis, emit-form, or eval.

  If :exception is not nil, then the following keys will also be part
  of the returned map:

  :exception-phase - If an exception was thrown, this is a keyword
      indicating in what portion of analyze-file's operation this
      exception occurred.  Always :analyze+eval or :eval

  :exception-form - If an exception was thrown, the current form being
      processed when the exception occurred.

  Options:
  - :reader  a pushback reader to use to read the namespace forms
  - :opt     a map of analyzer options
    - :debug A set of keywords.
      - :all Enable all of the following debug messages.
      - :progress Print simple progress messages as analysis proceeds.
      - :ns Print all namespaces that exist according to (all-ns)
            before analysis begins, and then only when that set of
            namespaces changes after each form is analyzed.
      - :forms Print forms just before analysis, both before and after
               macroexpanding them.
      - :forms-pprint Pretty-print forms just before analysis, both
                      before and after macroexpanding them.
