;; Before Clojure 1.8.0, an :op :def node resulting from a defn form would
;; have its :init value equal to an AST node with :op :fn

;; Clojure 1.8.0 changed things so that often (always?) the :op :def
;; node has an :init value being an AST node with :op :with-meta, and
;; _that_ AST node has an :expr key whose value is the AST node
;; with :op :fn.

;; Handle both of those cases here.

(defn elide-defprotocol-vars
  "Motivation: pprint'ing a value containing a defprotocol Var, with
all metadata included leads to an infinite loop.  Why?  The value of a
defprotocol's Var is a map.

(1) The value of the key :var in this map is the defprotocol Var
    itself, and pprint'ing this recurses infinitely.

(2) The value of the key :method-builders in this map has metadata
    containing the defprotocol Var, so if metadata is being printed, this
    also leads to an infinite loop.

These problems are most simply avoided by removing these two keys from
defprotocol maps.

Note: This can replace Vars in the AST with their values, so the
resulting AST is not as it was originally, and will likely fail if you
try to generate code from it.  It is fine for pprint'ing.

There are cases where this function misses things.  It seems like it
may be simpler to detect protocol occurrences while doing
pprint-meta instead."
